# Rony Levi 

Here you will find two different types of automation testing. I created a few classes to support my project, I didn't want to spend too much time breaking all methods to pieces. I also wrote the code in a few ways, just to show that there's more than one option to build your project
** I added sleep time between a few actions so you will have enough time to review.

**How to run**
- >$ git clone git@github.com:LeviRony/Rony_Task.git
- Open Project > Download Resources > **Run** TestSuit ```/test-suites/sanityFrontEnd.xml```
